	\e
		    I am a 25 year old programmer living in Portland Oregon. I have been daddling in programming since I was a teenager, only to 
		become very serious about making a career out of it with my introduction to Ruby and Rails in 2012. I have a passion for learning
		about all things related to techonlogy, whether that be the newest TDD concepts or Old Design Patterns, and I derive great enjoyment
		tackling and solving problems.\n\n
